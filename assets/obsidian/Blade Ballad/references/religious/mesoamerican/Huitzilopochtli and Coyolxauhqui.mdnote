A variation on a common creation myth from Aztec culture.

**Huitzilopochtli**, the Aztec god of the sun and war, was born fully armed from his mother **Coatlicue**, who had become pregnant in a miraculous way when a ball of feathers fell from the sky and touched her. Huitzilopochtli's birth is central to his myth as it involves a dramatic confrontation with his sister **Coyolxauhqui** and his 400 brothers, the Centzon Huitznahua (stars).

**Coyolxauhqui**, the moon goddess, and her brothers were enraged by the disgrace they felt due to their mother's mysterious pregnancy. They conspired to kill Coatlicue, but as they approached, Huitzilopochtli emerged fully grown and armed from his mother. He fiercely defended his mother by slaughtering his sister, Coyolxauhqui, and dismembering her, throwing her body from the hill of Coatepec where she was slain. Her head became the moon, according to the myth, serving as a reminder of the conflict and Huitzilopochtliâ€™s victory.

Huitzilopochtli sacrificed himself to become the sun, but Coyolxauhqui hated him and wanted to destroy him, so every night, when the moon (Coyolxauhqui) rises, it symbolizes an attempt to destroy the sun (Huitzilopochtli), in which Huitzilopochtli always win, and a new day starts.
