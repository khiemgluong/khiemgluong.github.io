# Parables of Matthew
### Parable of the Lamp
[Matthew 5:14-16](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+5:14-16)
- “You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.

### Parable of the Speck and The Log
[Matthew 7:1-5](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+7:1-5)
- “Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.

### Parable of New Cloth on Old Garment
[Matthew 9:16-17](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+9:16-17)
- “No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse. Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.”

### Parable of The Divided Kingdom 
[Matthew 12:24-30](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+12:24-30)
- But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.” Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand? And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. “Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man’s house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house. “Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.

### Parable of The Sower 
[Matthew 13:1-23](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+13:1-23)
- That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. Then he told them many things in parables, saying: “A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. Whoever has ears, let them hear.” The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?” He replied, “Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. This is why I speak to them in parables:
	- “Though seeing, they do not see;  
        though hearing, they do not hear or understand.
    
	    In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah:
	    
	    “‘You will be ever hearing but never understanding;  
	        you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.  
	        For this people’s heart has become calloused;  
	        they hardly hear with their ears,  
	        and they have closed their eyes.  
	    Otherwise they might see with their eyes,  
	        hear with their ears,  
	        understand with their hearts  
	    and turn, and I would heal them.’
	    
    But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it. “Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path. The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful. But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it. This is the one who produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.”
    

### Parable of The Weeds Among the Wheat - [Matthew 13:24-30](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+13:24-30)
- Jesus told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. “The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’
    
    “‘An enemy did this,’ he replied.
	“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’
    
    “‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’”

### Parable of The Mustard Seed - [Matthew 13:31-32](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+13:31-32)
- He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.”

### Parable of The Leaven - [Matthew 13:33-34](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+13:33-34)
- He told them still another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds[a] of flour until it worked all through the dough.” Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable.

### Parable of Hidden Treasure
[Matthew 13:44](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/13-44.html)
- “The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.

### Parable of Pearl of Great Price
[Matthew 13:45-46](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+13:45-46)
- “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.

### Parable of The Net
[Matthew 13:47-50](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+13:47-50)
- “Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away. This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

### Parable of The Heart of Man 
[Matthew 15:10-20](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+15:10-20)
- Jesus called the crowd to him and said, “Listen and understand. What goes into someone’s mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them.”
    
    Then the disciples came to him and asked, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?”
    
    He replied, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots. Leave them; they are blind guides.[a] If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.”
    
    Peter said, “Explain the parable to us.”
    
    “Are you still so dull?” Jesus asked them. “Don’t you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body? But the things that come out of a person’s mouth come from the heart, and these defile them. For out of the heart come evil thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander. These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them.”

### Parable of The Unforgiving Servant 
[Matthew 18:23-35](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+18:23-35)
- “Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him. Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.
    
    “At this the servant fell on his knees before him. ‘Be patient with me,’ he begged, ‘and I will pay back everything.’ The servant’s master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go.

    “But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins. He grabbed him and began to choke him. ‘Pay back what you owe me!’ he demanded.
    
    “His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay it back.’
    
    “But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. When the other servants saw what had happened, they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened.
    
    “Then the master called the servant in. ‘You wicked servant,’ he said, ‘I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. Shouldn’t you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?’ In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed.
    
    “This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.”

### Parable of Laborers in the Vineyard 
[Matthew 20:1-16](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+20:1-16)
- “For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. He agreed to pay them a denarius[a] for the day and sent them into his vineyard.
    
    “About nine in the morning he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing. He told them, ‘You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.’ So they went.
    
    “He went out again about noon and about three in the afternoon and did the same thing. About five in the afternoon he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, ‘Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?’
    
    “‘Because no one has hired us,’ they answered.
    
    “He said to them, ‘You also go and work in my vineyard.’
    
    “When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.’
    
    “The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius. So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius. When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner. ‘These who were hired last worked only one hour,’ they said, ‘and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.’
    
    “But he answered one of them, ‘I am not being unfair to you, friend. Didn’t you agree to work for a denarius? Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you. Don’t I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?’
    
    “So the last will be first, and the first will be last.”

### Parable of The Two Sons 
[Matthew 21:28-32](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+21:28-32)
- “What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work today in the vineyard.’
    
    “‘I will not,’ he answered, but later he changed his mind and went.
    
    “Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I will, sir,’ but he did not go.
    
    “Which of the two did what his father wanted?”
    
    “The first,” they answered.
    
    Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.
(I have no idea what this is supposed to teach)

### Parable of The Tenant Farmers 
[Matthew 21:33-45](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+21:33-45)
- “Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place. When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.
    
    “The tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third. Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way. Last of all, he sent his son to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said.
    
    “But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him and take his inheritance.’ So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
    
    “Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?”
    
    “He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,” they replied, “and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.”
    
    Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures:
    
    “‘The stone the builders rejected
        has become the cornerstone;
    
    the Lord has done this,
        and it is marvelous in our eyes’?
    
    “Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. 44 Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.”
    wisdom 1 - On Wealth
    When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus’ parables, they knew he was talking about them.

### Parable of the [Marriage](https://www.biblestudytools.com/topical-verses/marriage-bible-verses/) Feast 
[Matthew 22:1-14](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+22:1-14)
- Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come.
    
    “Then he sent some more servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’
    
    “But they paid no attention and went off—one to his field, another to his business. The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them. The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
    
    “Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come. So go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.’ So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, the bad as well as the good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
    
    “But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes. He asked, ‘How did you get in here without wedding clothes, friend?’ The man was speechless.
    
    “Then the king told the attendants, ‘Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
    
    “For many are invited, but few are chosen.”
    

### Parable of The Budding Fig Tree
[Matthew 24:32-35](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+24:32-35)
- “Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it[a] is near, right at the door. Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.

### Parable of The Ten Virgins
[Matthew 25:1-13](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+25:1-13)
- “At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish and five were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. The wise ones, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps. The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
    
    “At midnight the cry rang out: ‘Here’s the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’
    
    “Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. 8 The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’
    
    “‘No,’ they replied, ‘there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’
    
    “But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.
    
    “Later the others also came. ‘Lord, Lord,’ they said, ‘open the door for us!’
    
    “But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I don’t know you.’
    
    “Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.
### Parable of The Lost Sheep 
[Matthew 18:10-14](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/passage/?q=matthew+18:10-14)

- “See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.
    
    “What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off? And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off. In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish.
