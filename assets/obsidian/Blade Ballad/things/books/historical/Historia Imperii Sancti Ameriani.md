History of the Holy Amerian Empire VOL 1

A long time ago, the world was split up in many beastly nations, tribes and cults, of barbaric and uncivilized caste, who cannot create but only destroy. One was a bug/insect like locust people who devoured everything to the roots, turning every place they go to a barren wasteland, which will one day form into the [[Jinzech Dynasty]]. Another was a tribe from the south, who would consume their own, as spoils of war, or as ceremonial rites.

One day, our holy emperor, [[Amerius Triumphus]], was placed on this earth by divine miracle, with the purpose of eradicating these beastly nations. Being without parents, he was raised by a lion, who taught him strength, but also cunning and strategy.

This divine gift had a condition however, and that [[Amerius Triumphus]] must use it and lead his men to conquer all of the earth in the name of these Gods, and will live for eternity if he was to succeed.

Upon reaching his 200th year, Amerius embarked on his divine mission, a millennia-spanning campaign to bring peace and civilization to the known world. He conquered vast territories, which he named after himself. Yet, his ultimate test remained—the holy city of [[Vinsalem]], guarded by a creature known as the [[Golim]]. As the legend goes, this creature of red clay, stained with the blood of those it had slain, was said to be invincible, made eternal by the wine that granted life without end, the wine that gave [[Vinsalem]] its namesake.

It was not by sword or spear that the [[Golim]] could be defeated but through mastery of words, soul, and wit—a challenge that Decimus, for all his physical prowess, could not overcome. After [[Amerius Triumphus]] retreated, the [[Golim]] was disassembled, and the wine, brewed by ancient wizards, was sealed away beneath the city, in hopes that it would never be used again.

Due to this, he was not granted the immortality he wanted, instead, the Gods punished him for his failure, and cursed his spirit to his progeny, so that all his children must finish what he started or his spirit will never be free.

The first [[Amerius Triumphus]] lived for over 10,000 years, but every subsequent child thereon lived a little shorter.

Today, the 145th generation [[Amerius Triumphus]] rules the [[Holy Amerian Empire]], with only one goal: To complete the quest his ancestors failed to complete. With each generation, the resolve strengthens, fueled by the hope to succeed where their forefather could not, to finally achieve eternal peace and release [[Amerius Triumphus]] from his ethereal bonds.
