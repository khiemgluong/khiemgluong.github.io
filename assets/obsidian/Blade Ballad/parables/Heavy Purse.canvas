The value of a piece of gold remains unchanged whether it is earned through a day of honest toil or stolen from the hands of that same laborer, and perhaps it is this indifference to human morality that makes it such a dangerous object to possess.\"\n**You**: \"Yes, it is merely an object, a medium, it cannot determine wickedness from morality, for this responsibility lays on the state which mints this coin.\"\n**Jaqub**: \"You speak truth, yet you miss the hypocrisy: How can the state judge the righteousness and wickedness of its people, yet could not impart that same judgement on their coins which moves their entire empire? Furthermore, how could man have the right to determine wickedness of another man, a right only God can have?\"\n**You**: \"Perhaps this is where corruption lays. Where morality lies in the human, it is absent in the coin. Thus, one in theory could devote oneself to amassing coins and, with great wealth, 'purchase' morality and 'bail' themselves from sin.\"\n**Jaqub**: \"This reveals a fundamental flaw in our system, a deceit at its core that must be upheld lest it collapse. Yet, I have come to understand that God sees through their tricks and will punish them in ways mortals cannot fathom.\"\nYou: \"Does this have something to do with the gold that I've acquired?\"\n**Jaqub**: \"Indeed, it does. Money, as an amoral object of material value, attracts those who are likewise amoral or immoral, and the heavier the purse, the greater the attraction.\"\nYou: \"Are you saying that this gold is likely putting us in danger?\"\n**Jaqub**: \"I cannot confirm it, but it would be wise to rid yourself of these coins or keep your wealth modest, lest you draw the attention of fools and bandits. The eyes of the wicked are hidden, revealing their true nature only when it is too late.\"","x":-1500,"y":80,"width":859,"height":627},

It is as tangible as the coins in your purse, coins that will inevitably draw thieves and cutthroats to you, like predators to prey.\"\n**You**: \"I understand your concern, but isn't it an exaggeration to say that wealth inherently attracts thieves? It's not the money itself that's at fault. It's how people choose to use it. Money can bring freedom and opportunities.\"\n**Jaqub**: \"You are mistaken. The coins in your purse are mere metals that burden you with weight and attachments. They bind and control you, offering false promises without regard to moral implications. It is not just about the danger from others, but from the desires money stirs within you.

No matter how much coin you possess, you cannot barter with God or redeem yourself with gold.\"\nYou: \"The ship is sinking! What must I do?\"\n**Jaqub**: \"Consider this parable: A man laden with gold walked through the forest, confident in his wealth's protection. Yet, as he journeyed, the weight of his riches slowed him, and he was beset by bandits. Another man, with only enough to meet his needs, walked unencumbered and reached his destination safely. So it is with those who seek after wealth; they burden themselves and invite danger, while those who seek after God's wisdom walk a safer, surer path. Heed this omen in the earthly realm, for as this ship sinks, so may your life, if you let your coin purse pull you down to the bottom of the ocean, or cast it overboard and ascend to God's embrace.\"\n\n***[[Disciple Jaqub]] disappears, leaving you alone on the sinking ship to decide your fate.***","x":-97,"y":194,"width":687,"height":679},
