A potent amnesiac. Can be ingested as a drink or smoked as crystalized rocks.
Derived from the daffodil flower, scientific name *Narcissus*.
Slightly biege/soft yellow in color, owing to the yellow color of the daffodil.
Its production and trafficking is overseen by the [[Metzacoatl Cartel]], a semi-recognized drug state.
Illegal in the [[Holy Amerian Empire]], but is where it is mostly sold at.

Analogous to morphine, the base active ingredient in many illegal drugs today.

Can induce hallucinations and other mental disorders for heavy users, loss of grip on reality.
Turns people into "zombies", non-sentient and barely living; the drug turns off most of their vital organ functions except muscle, so these zombies can live very long without food, water or sleep.
