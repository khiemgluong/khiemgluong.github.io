A small device which can be integrated into a piece of armor or weapon.

Charges up an energy force each time a piece of armor or weapon receives or delivers an attack, i.e kinetic energy, and stores it in a battery like device. 
It accumulates kinetic energy, hence the name.

Once the battery is full, the user can release the stored energy, such as onto their weapon, to create a shaped charge from the edge of the blade, allowing the swing to deliver a supercharged attack, cutting through heavy metal armor. This then drains the battery and can be rebuilt by receiving or delivering more kinetic energy.
