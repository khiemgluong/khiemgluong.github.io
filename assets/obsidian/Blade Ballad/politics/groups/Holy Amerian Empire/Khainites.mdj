Singular: Khainite (People of Khain)

Original a tribe from the East, in what's now part of the [[Jinzech Dynasty]], they left due to what they felt was oppression, but also due to heavy influence of American cultural export.

Most of them adopted an American surname, but kept their last name

Being Jingzhech descendants, they are somewhat communistic, materialistic and xenophobic, but ironically also very open to [[Holy Amerian Empire]] money and influence. Their de fact clan leader is Secretary General

Immigrated to [[Fajjarah]] after the [[Triumvates]] has established a foothold on this land. They work hard to earn their keep, but it never seems to go anywhere.

The people condemned by birthright by the [[Triumvates]], being born of the "serpent seed". They populate the lower class demographic in [[Fajjarah]], and generally labors and perform mundane work for their masters.

Most of them are poor, but try desperately to live like a [[Triumvates]], which is often outside of their means. They try to ascend their social class by entering schools, working hard, being courteous, but all of them, even those who appear to go far, never actually assume a real position of power and influence, while the rest fall into crippling debt from these endeavors and doom themselves and their families to a lifetime of servitude to the real [[Triumvates]]. 
Some of them will turn to selling [[Narcican]], an illegal substance. Some do it out of vengefulness for their condition, and do so to tarnish the ruling class.
