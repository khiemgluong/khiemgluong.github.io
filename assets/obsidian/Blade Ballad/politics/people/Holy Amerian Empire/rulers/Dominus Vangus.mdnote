Consul (Governor) of [[Fajjarah]], part of the [[Holy Amerian Empire]].
Consuls rule in duos, as a form of checks and balance, his other consul is [[Gaius Maximus]]
Supports the [[Imperial Cult]] (since you need to if you want a position of power in the empire)

Extremely judgmental, but sympathetic to the [[Khainites]] immigrants.

The secret of course, being in his last name, is that he is a Khainite himself, an exiled member of the [[Khainites]] from long ago, and a distant relative of the [[Jinzech Dynasty]]
