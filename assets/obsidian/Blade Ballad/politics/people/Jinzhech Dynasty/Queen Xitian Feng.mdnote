[How a queen ant is created](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_ant)

Queen Xitian Feng takes on a near insect-like appearance. She is humanoid in figure but is mostly anthropomorphized into a queen ant. The only human like features are her face, but eyes are like that of a bee. 

In the tradition of some ant colonies where only the queen reproduces, [[Queen Xitian Feng]] has delegated this task to her many "princesses". These princesses lay hundreds of thousands of worker drones, all of which are clones of the queen herself.

Her lifespan, akin to that of an ant queen, is very long but not immortal. As a queen nears the end of her life, she secretly chooses one of her princesses as her "successor", transferring all her knowledge and personality to this new queen before secretly disappearing. This practice has perpetuated the illusion of the queen's immortality, sustaining the dynasty for thousands of years.

In her role as a "leader," Queen Xitian Feng's existence is paradoxical. Surrounded solely by clones of herself, she never interacts with anyone or anything unique, effectively isolating her from diversity and new experiences. There is no true engagement with individuality or innovation, leaving her in a perpetual cycle of self-reflection and repetition.

Despite a latent desire to meet new people and encounter new things, [[Queen Xitian Feng]] remains highly hostile to foreigners, fearing that external influences might destabilize her meticulously maintained dynasty or figure out her secret.

Her personality is thus can be described as xenophobic and detached from reality, from generations of self imposed isolation.
