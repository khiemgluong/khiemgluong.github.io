*The Blasphemer* is prophetic and enigmatic figure which underpins the plot of Blade Ballad.

His story shares similarities with Jesus Christ, as he travels the world spreading his teachings of the  [[Awakened#Eternal Soul|Eternal Soul]] to his disciples, though he does not claim to be the son of God or possess divine qualities. His story also shares some similarities to Buddha, as he comes from an aristocratic family yet abandoned that lifestyle due to its morally corrupting nature, often spending time in solitude meditating.

He is the center of the [[Awakened]] movement, which many states have condemned.
