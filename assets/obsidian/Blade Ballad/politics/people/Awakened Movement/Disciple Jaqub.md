![[Disciple Jaqub.wav]]
Before meeting [[You]], Jaqub will be wandering around [[The Chapparal]] near [[Muttisia]], foraging and begging to get by.

A herbal shaman by trade who once healed people of his his tribe which has now been incorporated into the [[Holy Amerian Empire]]. 
Later, the Empire deemed his practice profane and incongruent with those standardized and accepted by the [[Universitates Imperialis Amerianum]], and forced him to abandon his old trade or never be allowed to practice medicine again; he chose the latter.
It was due to this ostracization that [[Disciple Jaqub]] lost faith in the Empire and began distancing himself from it

In a historical Roman context, he might have been labeled as "medici vagi" (wandering doctors) or "magi" (magicians), especially if their practices involved elements considered mystical or outside the accepted medical knowledge of the time. The term "magi" had a broad meaning, often associated with those who practiced magic or astrology, which was generally viewed with suspicion by the authorities. As such, if [[You]] keep him as a follower, he can offer medical assistance for injuries.

Nordic phenotype.
