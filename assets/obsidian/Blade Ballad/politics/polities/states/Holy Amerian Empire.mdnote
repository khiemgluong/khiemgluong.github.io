# Culture
The [[Holy Amerian Empire]]'s cultural foundation is built upon an edifice of pride and vanity, forged through centuries of conquest. Its people prioritize grandiose displays over truthfulness, crafting elaborate facades to impress and intimidate others. The pursuit of glory and social status is paramount, with individuals vying for attention and prestige.

As such, the men, many of which were assimilated from conquered tribes with warlike pagan backgrounds, are focused on martial pursuits, striving to become powerful leaders in their legionary ranks. This masculine energy is embodied by the [[Imperial Cult]], which celebrates the strength and prowess of its male adherents.

Meanwhile, women play a crucial role in nurturing the Empire's extravagance and vanities, so they too can create the conflict which the empire feeds upon. Although they may not wield formal power due to societal norms, they are permitted to indulge in fantasies of grandeur through their worship of [[Vidaris]], a goddess promising temporary, fleeting "glory" of their own for those willing to make dark pacts.

Thus, the [[Holy Amerian Empire]] exists in a state of perpetual "division", engaged in continuous conflict both within its borders and with neighboring states, across numerous social strata including gender, race, age, and occupation. Yet in this way, the deep-seated discord has propelled them to make significant advancements in both warfare and the arts because its people are continually driven by the desire for glory and the need to prove themselves in a constantly evolving environment.

This will prove to be their weakness. Their endless need to prove themselves often end up causing mutually destructive internecine conflicts.

# Economy
The empire's relation to money to indifferent, as the Empire's leaders have come to understand that military might is a more reliable means of securing power and influence than gold or silver. With their formidable legions at their disposal, they recognized that sufficient physical force can enforce authority beyond what any amount of currency can achieve. 

But to avoid appearing as ignorant savages no different from the countless tribes it has conquered, the empire established a banking "system" known as the [[Reservatus Imperialis]]. However, this is only a facade maintained through violence and intimidation by enforcers who are not mathematicians but war veterans rewarded with comfortable positions after violent careers. Consequently, this means that the empire's economy is entirely artificial; devoid of genuine economic activity, profit, or loss, but a fabrication perpetuated by the authorities who threaten violence against anyone who dares to disagree or expose the truth.
