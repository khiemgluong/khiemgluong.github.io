Independent tribe bordering the [[Holy Amerian Empire]], modeled after Germanic tribes.

Their druids synthesized the raw form of [[Narcican]] created by the [[Hualxochitl]], turning it into the super potent amnesiac which is the final form of Narcican that is being trafficked today.

It was a [[Metzacoatl Cartel|Metzocoatl]] who traveled here to learn alchemical secrets possessed by the [[Mondk√ºlt]] by providing them with a raw natural form of [[Narcican]] then synthesizing it to a far more potent and addictive form, which would then be trafficked to the [[Holy Amerian Empire]] and lead to the establishment of the [[Metzacoatl Cartel]].

Named derived from german language, "Mond" for moon and "kult " for cult.
