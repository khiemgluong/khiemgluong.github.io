Cognamen: Â **Equitum** (Horsemen) or Circularium (an allude to catch-22)

The 22nd Legion of the [[Holy Amerian Empire]]. Their cognamen derives from the legion consisting almost exclusively of cavalry, with the footmen serving as auxiliaries, garrison detachments when they reached an outpost, or being camp followers.

The legion is thus very fast and can cover a lot of ground, but can only leverage this advantage when traveling on flat, solid ground such as the [[Medicine Hill]] prairies. 

Primarily an expeditionary force, they role is to attempt control of small [[Metzacoatl Cartel]] tribes such as the [[Tukesaunee]].

Thus they are deployed to the south of the [[Holy Amerian Empire]], where the hilly, forested and mountainous terrain of the North could not capitalize on this advantage.
