Led by [[Yuknoom Kaan]]
A semi-autonomous, semi-sovereign drug state. It is very wealthy and powerful, having resources almost equal to the [[Holy Amerian Empire]] due to its sale of [[Narcican]]. However, because [[Narcican]] is illegal, they are not officially recognized as a state, nor can their citizens  receive rights. This lack of protection often leads to brutal and inhuman acts by the cartel, driving people to immigrate to safer countries such as the [[Holy Amerian Empire]].

# Government
Highly bureaucratic, everyone is given a "role" and they in turn must provide more "roles" to people, but most will not do any actual work.
> Its supposed to be a reflection on the political system of liberal and democratic states.
# Culture
Drugs are central to the culture of the Metzacoatl people, a practice which they've engaged in for thousands of years with natural herbs and flowers, and it was [[Hualxochitl|they]] who first discovered the psychological effects of natural [[Narcican]]. 

However, after the Metzacoatl people learned powerful alchemical recipes from the [[Mondkült]] tribe to the north, they were able to synthesize a drug even more potent than any, which they called Narcican. From then on, [[Narcican]] became an integral part of their culture and society, shaping their beliefs, traditions, and way of life, becoming so widespread that it became difficult for the Metzacoatl people to function without them.

﻿Despite their "friendly" demeanor and "warm" behavior, the [[Metzacoatl Cartel|Metzacoatl]] people's corrupt and violent culture make their friendliness seem uncanny, forced, and perhaps just a result of being under the influence of drugs. Despite the deteriorating effects it has on their health and society, they continue to use [[Narcican]] as a means to an end, subjecting themselves to any job or status imaginable if it means getting their hands on another dose.

Today, [[Narcican]] is no longer used for recreational purposes; instead, it has become the driving force behind the [[Metzacoatl Cartel]]'s actions. Anyone who stands in their way often meets a fatal end, and they will do anything to get their hands on more of it, whether to consume or traffic. The lack of control and human senses that it brings has contributed greatly to the increasing violence and death that plagues the [[Metzacoatl Cartel]].

# Economy
Their economy is primarily driven by the drug trade and immigrant labor. The lack of real honest work in the Cartel means that most people will have to participate in the drug trade at some point. Otherwise, those who refuse to participate cross into the [[Holy Amerian Empire]] hoping to earn an honest living there. Sadly, this does not grant them salvation, because they are now serving the very people who propagate the drug trade, since the empire's citizens have plenty of [[Holy Amerian Empire#Economy|disposable income]] to spend on vices like [[Narcican]], who now have access to a large army of cheap Metzacoatl migrant laborers, making their situation even more dire.
