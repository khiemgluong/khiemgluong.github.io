# Culture

Only official members of the dynasty family have names, most do not have official ones, just family nicknames, or referred to as a number at their place of employment.
The Jinzhech people, guided by the teachings of [[Bugadava]], are a society deeply rooted in imitation and collective harmony. They value conformity and the wisdom of their leader, [[Queen Xitian Feng]], who epitomizes success through adaptation and learning from other cultures.

This creates a culture that, while outwardly prosperous through imitation, is inwardly plagued by corruption and lack of originality. The Jinzhech people live in a world where everything is a reflection of others, unable to forge their own path. The most tragic aspect, however, is not the poverty or the corruption, but the inability to recognize it. They fail to see that their suffering is self-inflicted, rooted in their own selfishness and worship of money. Ultimately, their society, while stable, becomes stagnant, with lives shaped not by their own making, but by the shadows of the cultures they emulate.

# Economy
Their working population (>90% of the population) are referred to as "drones", like the ant drone. Most of their economy is driven by manufacturing cheap goods for exporting to other countries. Drones work on an average 100 hours a day, but their worship of money which is closely tied to their [[Bugadava|god]] makes it tolerable.

Their relationship to money is deeply intertwined with their beliefs. As they are unable to influence others through physical force or moral persuasion, they must rely on financial means to express their needs. The Jinzhech person, focused solely on material needs, pays attention only to things that confer material wealth, such as money. Consequently, [[Bugadava]] is often depicted as sitting on a gold lotus, surrounded by lavish items and goods, symbolizing the influence over its followers.

However, this emphasis on conformity and imitation comes at a significant cost. The Jinzhech do not pursue ideals such as personal perfection, individuality, or creating self-worth. As such, they are extremely cautious with what money they have; any slight loss or mismanagement of funds can plunge them into poverty, making it impossible to provide for themselves and their comparatively large families. This fosters a deeply corrupt culture where financial influence becomes paramount. To advance in Jinzhech society, one must be willing to pay bribes or engage in other forms of corruption to access resources and opportunities. This leads to a lack of transparency and accountability within the colony, as individuals prioritize their self-interest over the well-being of others.
