"The Concealer"

The goddess of illusions and mirages. She has the ability to create vivid, lifelike illusions that can deceive even the most discerning eyes. Her mirages can be so convincing that they are almost indistinguishable from reality.


To those who do not believe in the [[Awakened]], her illusions and tricks are indiscernible from reality, but those who do can see through it, and thus she is very hostile towards follower of [[The Blasphemer]], as they are cannot be tricked.
