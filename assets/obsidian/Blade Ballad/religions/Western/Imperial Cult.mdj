The official religion of the [[Holy Amerian Empire]].

They worship the late emperor, [[Amerius Triumphus]], as a demigod, and uses their relation to him as a source of power. 
> ﻿﻿During the Empire era of ancient Rome, rulers were often depicted as divine beings or even as gods themselves.

Likewise, [[Holy Amerian Empire]] emperors all bear the [[Amerius Triumphus]] name followed by their generation number in the lineage. The current generation is [[Amerius Triumphus#CXLV (145th)|CXLV]].

Marble statues are created depicting [[Amerius Triumphus]] as a bull headed warrior god:

The ultimate source of authority for the Emperor, and its constituents, such as the [[Universitates Imperialis Amerianum]].

Followed by the [[Triumvates]] before fractioning to have [[Awakened]] worshippers as well. 

The pursuit in their belief revolves in an essence derived from "Aspera", roughly translated to "struggle" or "hardship" from Latin. They believe that pain, without much consideration to context, is the ultimate source of power, and more pain is more power. 

In this, [[Imperial Cult]] followers takes a very sadistic and masochistic approach to others and themselves, although they do this with good intention.
