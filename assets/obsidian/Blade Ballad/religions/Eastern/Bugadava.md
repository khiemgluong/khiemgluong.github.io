[[Bugadava]]'s values are rooted in imitation and egalitarianism. The [[Jinzech Dynasty|Jinzech]] People see themselves as part of a larger collective and value their ability to learn from other cultures and states. They believe that by copying and stealing what is good or valuable, they can improve their own society and achieve greatness.

The people follow Bugadava for guidance on how to live in harmony with the colony and its queen. They see Queen Xitian Feng as a powerful leader who has achieved success through her ability to adapt and learn from other cultures. The Jinzhech People seek her blessings for their own success and prosperity, but also understand that they must work hard and be loyal to the colony in order to achieve these goals.

>"An ant line knows no wrong turnâ€”follow the one ahead, wherever they lead."

Like an ant line, [[Bugadava]] embodies the value of being good followers, insisting that one must always stick behind the person in front, regardless of the destination. This belief system ingrains a deep sense of conformity within the Jinzech people. Individual aspirations and personal ambitions are suppressed in favor of collective progress and imitation. A Jinzech is one who is defined by their conformity and collective identity, finding value in their ability to follow and imitate.

This adherence to imitation is seen not as a flaw, but as a strength that allows them to continuously adapt and survive. Their food, architecture, culture, beliefs, and system of government are all influenced by other, more dominant societies such as the [[Holy Amerian Empire]], which they see as a way to ensure their own stability and prosperity.
