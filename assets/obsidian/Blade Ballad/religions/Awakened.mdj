The *swastika* of the [[Awakened]] religious movement.

--- 
A potential source of turmoil in the world. There is a person who has preached various beliefs which is contrarian to current social dogma, generally referred to as [[The Blasphemer]], who is the leader of the religious movement.

# Eternal Soul
The [[Awakened]] movement centers around a single universal truth: the existence of an eternal Soul that guides the universe, embodies the essence of humanity, and distinguishes humans from animals. Unlike other belief systems, it rejects narrow rules and violent punishments, advocating instead for a simple belief in the soul to discern good from bad and determine who possesses a Soul.

Followers are taught to place full trust in the existence and endless value of the eternal Soul, valuing it above any material thing. This belief system emphasizes spiritual awakening and moral clarity without the need for tests, trials, purchases, or rigid doctrines.

It poses a direct challenge to the authorities and societal norms of the [[Holy Amerian Empire]] and many other states since it threatens the established order and undermines the hierarchical and often punitive structures that govern society, promoting a more inclusive and compassionate worldview.

The implications of the Awakened movement are profound. Its potential to unify diverse belief systems under a single ideology could lead to the erasure of preexisting religions. 
Depending on your efforts and choices in the game, this movement could convert all current faiths to follow its teachings.. This
### Judgement
In order to become a member of this religion, you must undergo Judgement, or a clear declaration to a higher being that you are now under their supervision, that they will now impart judgement on you rather than man.
All acts you commit will be seen in full, so all good and humble deeds will be rewarded, but all bad ones will be punished as well.

# Principle Tenets
## Sin Inheritance
It is possible to have a perfect birth, to live an entire life free of struggle and sin, but this is only achieveable being from a bloodline who over several generations, display piety and devotion to the eternal soul, with each generation bearing less and less sin, if they persist in their devotion. Conversely, sin can be inherited by those who live degenerate and and false lives, sins which they and their children must bear. Those in sin are more inclined to sinning, and thus some bloodlines are heavily indebted in sin, some irredeemably so.

## Ignorance is not forgivable
Acknowledgement of an eternal Soul that guides you and all things in the world means that you are now cognizant of what is right or wrong, what is moral and immoral, how to treat others etc. This means that you cannot be forgiven for willful transgressions against these divine laws, since you are no longer ignorant to the truth.

## The Soul is imparts its power on all those who believe in it
The Soul is a mechanism in which one can exercise their truths and have it manifest in the physical world. This suggests an extremely powerful ability to completely subvert and ignore current laws, beliefs, requirements, and expectations and bend it to your will if you do not see truth in it, but elsewhere.

## Unity in separation
Ultimately, the soul is not something that can be possessed by everyone. It is only a power which can be wielded by humans, so animals, plants and many other living things cannot see this gift. It makes a clear division on who can and who cannot possess a soul, and this is one of its primary source of contention, because [[The Blasphemer]] have suggested that certain peoples and groups in this world are not humans, and thus can never have a soul, and must be kept separate from those who can possess it.

## Eye for an Eye
The concept of mirror punishment. It means that a person who causes harm or injury to another should receive a punishment equivalent to the harm they inflicted.

# Inspiration

Draws inspiration through the philosophies of [[Greek Philosophies#[Plato's theory of soul](https //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato%27s_theory_of_soul)|Plato's eternal soul]], i.e Platonist school of thought.
Concept of everyone being born in sin from Christianity, and that life is suffering, from Buddhism.
Draws inspiration from another ideology which I will not divulge.
