Plural: Pyrodontes
# Description
Pyrodontes are gigantic, mythical beasts resembling elephants, but covered in metal scales and equipped with iron tusks, serving as powerful constructors or destroyers for their human masters.

### Characteristics
- **Oil Consumption**: Pyrodontes exclusively derive their energy from consuming oil, which they require to perform their work. They do not die if deprived of it, but simply stop working until refueled.
- **Metallic Scales**: Pyrodontes have thick, overlapping scales made of a metal-like substance, providing them with natural armor. This makes them nearly impervious to attacks and environmental hazards.
- **Iron Tusks**: Instead of traditional tusks, Pyrodontes possess massive iron extrusions shaped like excavator buckets. These tusks are incredibly strong and sharp, perfect for digging, lifting, and breaking through tough materials.
- **Behemoth Size**: Towering over any ordinary elephant, Pyrodontes are colossal, their sheer size and strength allowing them to perform tasks that would be impossible for any other creature or machine.

### Usage

- **Construction**: Pyrodontes are the backbone of construction in many states. They are used to dig foundations, clear rubble, and lift heavy materials, significantly speeding up the building process.
- **Mining**: In mining operations, they are used to extract valuable minerals and ores from deep within the earth. Their tusks can break through the toughest rock, making them ideal for such tasks.
- **[War machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_elephant#Parthia_and_Sassanian_Persia)**: Their armored bodies and immense strength allowed them to fulfill various combat roles on the battlefield, such as carrying siege equipment to breach enemy fortifications, or even being the siege equipment themselves.

# Legends and Lore
According to ancient legends, Pyrodontes were a gift from the gods to the people of the [[Sahra'een Sultanate]]. It is said that the gods forged these beasts from the very metals of the earth, breathing life into them and bestowing them upon humanity to aid in their grand endeavors.
