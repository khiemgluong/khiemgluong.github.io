Here [[You|you]] will be presented the challenge of listening and documenting. Transcribing logs of current events so people can sell as newspaper that existed in ancient Rome (*Acta Diurna*)

Something like a minigame, an orator will speak out an event and you must copy it down in a reasonable time. There will be no repeats, so listen carefully, as you are only paid for accurate accounting. Use a text-to-speech ai for this

The events to record would be in chronological order, and will follow several narratives. For example, one day could involve scribing down the events of the king/emperor which will iterate as time goes, other days it might be stories from the blasphemer, events from foreign nations, current events. The event will only be completed if you've successfully transcribed it

Do 5 of these (you can only do 1 a day), and unlock more dialogue from [[The Forum]] admin.
