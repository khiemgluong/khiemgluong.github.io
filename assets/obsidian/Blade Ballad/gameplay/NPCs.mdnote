# NPCs
I wanted to emulate the NPC behavior seen in Bethesda games like Fallout: New Vegas and Skyrim, where NPCs display both reactive and routine passive behaviors:
## Schedule
NPCs, regardless of importance, will follow a general schedule, which in its simplest form is to go to a predefined number of locations at a given time, triggered by a global time interval action. For example, an NPC might spend part of the day at a guard post, then move to an inn in the evening, with this pattern repeating daily. This kind of behavior works well with a Behavior Tree solution.
