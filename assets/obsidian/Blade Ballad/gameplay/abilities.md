# Beggar's Blessing
**Beggarsâ€™ Blessing** is activated indefinitely after wearing the [[Missionary Cloak]] for at least one day without changing out of them, and is deactivated as soon as the cloak is removed.
This ability unlocks a unique dialogue option with every NPC, allowing you to ask them for money. While the request is the same, NPC responses vary, but most will give you a small sum of gold for food and shelter. 
There is a daily limit on how much you can beg, but it is sufficient to keep you nourished, allowing you to focus solely on missionary work without needing to work or loot.
NPCs may sometimes approach you to offer gold out of pity.
