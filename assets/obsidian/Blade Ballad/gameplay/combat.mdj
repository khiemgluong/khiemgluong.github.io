# procedural blade control
Combat revolves around swordplay, but works a little differently. You have much more control over the **angle** and **position** of your blade, which allows you to rotate it 360 degrees at any angle in response to a mouse vector. This is different than your typical sword fighting games where there is no consideration to attack angle, or the attack angle is very limited to 4 or 5 cardinal directions.
This makes the sword combat in Blade Ballad more *skill based* than *stat based*. While faster, sharper and bigger swords no doubt gives an advantage, it is more so your ability to precisely angle and position your blade to block an attack and then adjust its angle and position to target an exposed area of the enemy.
Attacks when connected, does *continuous* damage. Meaning, if you are able to completely slice through an enemy, each frame that the blade has struck will cause damage, rather than once at the first collision.

To imagine how melee combat controls work, envision a circle in front of your screen, to which your blade rotates within.
Now image that your screen is also a flat grid that has an x and y axis, which you can then pan your weapon anywhere on this grid.
