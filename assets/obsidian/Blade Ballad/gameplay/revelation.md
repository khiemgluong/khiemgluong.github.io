A revelation is the act of revealing or disclosing something that was previously hidden or unknown. It often refers to an enlightening or astonishing disclosure of information or truth. 

In a religious or spiritual context, a revelation can be a divine or supernatural disclosure to humans, such as insights about the nature of existence, moral truths, or knowledge of a deity's will. In a more general sense, it can refer to any significant or surprising piece of information that becomes known, leading to a change in understanding or perspective.

In Blade Ballad, for simplicity, it simply points towards interesting landmarks where certain valuables (mythical gear, books, maps, people) can be found, appearing as a dream-like scenes after your character goes to sleep in game, or certain ethereal voices that tries to communicate with you at random times.
