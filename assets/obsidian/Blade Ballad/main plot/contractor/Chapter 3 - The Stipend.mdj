- You arrive at [[Kalahknaab]] of the [[Metzacoatl Cartel]]
- This is an attempt at the empire at securing the cartel drug industry operating out of the [[Metzacoatl Cartel]]
- Here you contact with the imperial ambassador for the cartel
- You are told that the [[Metzacoatl Cartel]] has [[The Blasphemer]] imprisoned, which you need to pay an exorbitantly high ransom for. However, if you could help the ambassador secure majority control from the business, then he can release [[The Blasphemer]] for you.
- You are tasked with kidnapping one of the head leaders, after fighting through his guards, and torturing him via Cartel fashion: dismembering each of his limbs until he capitulates
- Once he relinquishes control over the business, he will release [[The Blasphemer]], only to find that he has escaped
- Regardless, you will be given a stipend from the cartel business which is deposited in your imperial bank account every week.

- the [[Metzacoatl Cartel]] continues to exist, but will send coyotes after you as retribution
