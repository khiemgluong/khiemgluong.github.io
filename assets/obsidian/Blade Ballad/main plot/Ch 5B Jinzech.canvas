For when you observe their culture and practices in detail, you will find many similarities to the western [[Holy Amerian Empire]].\"\nYou: \"What do you mean?\"\nBlasphemer: \"It means that they are a people who have no identity, no culture or tradition, and for this which they lack, they adopt other cultures as their own. Of course, sharing knowledge and integrating outside knowledge in your own is nothing wrong, but the Jinzech people have done so much mimicking that there is little to no distinguishing characteristic about themselves anymore.\"\n\nBlasphemer: \"It strikes me as strange, when I think about how far the [[Jinzech Dynasty]] would have gotten, if the [[Holy Amerian Empire]] never existed or have never worked with them. Their advancements and civilization does not appear to be works of their own ingenuity, but something which was learned from the empire, as is everything else, their music, their entertainment, their technology, and even their religion, all seems to be an uncanny attempt at copying something the [[Holy Amerian Empire]] came up with with long ago.\"\nYou: \"What does this say about the [[Jinzech Dynasty|Jinzech]] people?\"\nBlasphemer: \"It leads me to conclude that the Jinzech are not people, but rather insectoid creatures. They yearn to be human, and they see the western world and its people to be as such, and they try to copy their behaviours, beliefs, and dreams, but in doing so, forget their own, and failing to understand that imitation can only achieve a superficial likeness, but never an authentic connection to those whom they copy from.\"\nYou: \"But it seems that they've created much from copying from the west, in fact their country is rather advantage compared to the other empires, almost on par with the Empire\"\nBlasphemer: \"No, they are not creators, for imitating is not creating. Indeed, their world appears advanced, but only *on par* with the [[Holy Amerian Empire]], for this is the source of their advancement, and without it they fall into obscurity and incompetence\"\nYou: \"Then how should they prove their worth and merit?\"\n\nBlasphemer: \"They must claim independence from the west and deny their knowledge. If they truly want to show the world of their intelligence and ingenuity, then they must create without guidance from the empire, to bring into the world something novel of their own doing. But this may be impossible, if they do not accept the eternal [[Awakened]] Soul.\"\n","x":-313,"y":357,"width":553,"height":1163}
