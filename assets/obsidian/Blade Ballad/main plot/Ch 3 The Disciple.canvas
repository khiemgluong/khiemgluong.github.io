This will give them great resentment to [[The Blasphemer]]\n#### If you're on the bounty contract without accepting Judgement\n- Dominus wants you to act as a draft officer, giving you authority to search and arrest any [[Khainites]] migrant who resists your order. This is in the response to the massive debts that the Khainites have accrued over time, and the draft serves as a way towards debt relief.\n\t- Recruit or subdue the given Khainite migrants and Dominus will tell you where [[The Blasphemer]] is.\n\t- This results in compliance for the Khainities, as the draft was an exercise of authority.\n\n","x":3520,"y":-105,"width":730,"height":870},

Eliminate personal ambition and individuality; everyone equally rewardedâ€”that's a Khainite for you.\"\n**You**: \"I have learned much from The Blasphemer and his disciples.

The Khainite, if you come to live with them for long enough, prefers to cause problems, often entirely avoidable ones, then complain that it's somehow our fault.\"\n**You**: \"This stems from the perceived inequalities they have suffered, thus, to remedy the problem they should be given benefits, welfare, tax cuts, i.e. certain privileges only granted to them.\"\n**Vangus**: \"We already give them more than they acknowledge. If these are The Blasphemer's teachings, they are laughable and naive.\"\n**You**: It does not have to be true equality, but merely a facade of it.. Redefine equality to fit your terms and force the [[Khainites]] to comply. Strip them of their traditions, folk religions, and culture in its name. If they resist, brand them as inegalitarian and unequalâ€”beat them at their own game.\"\n**Vangus**: \"Interesting strategy. You propose to deceive them and use their own tactics against them.\"\n**You**: \"Start by offering welfare incentives, but only if they accept The Blasphemer's teachings, whether sincerely or not, labeling those who refuse as \"intolerant\" and outcast them from society. Encourage them to attend schools where they must use your language, allow them to hold office but they can only espouse your views. This way, they will believe they are gaining equality and power, but over time, they will lose their cultural identity and independence, strengthening your control over them.\"\n**Vangus**: \"Hahaha, now I see why they call him [[The Blasphemer]]. But your proposal is well thought out and actionable, so I shall adopt his teachings not as a spiritual guide, but as a political tool. The Khainites will be forced to embrace this 'tolerant' doctrine and renounce their ways, or be branded as 'inegalitarians' and face ostracism.\"\n**You**: \"I thank you for accepting the blasphemer.\"\n**Vangus**: \"I wouldn't say accepted, more like leveraged.
