* [[You]] wake up in your bed as a farmer in [[Muttisia]].
* You work as a farmer indefinitely, since you need the income to pay for rent and food, and this goes on as long as you live here.
* You are ignorant to the brewing political turmoil which is the coming of a messiah considered to be blasphemous with their new religious movement, [[Awakened]]
* Each week, the [[Rent Collector]] will come to your home to collect rent payments. If you can't pay you will be kicked out of [[Muttisia]].
* You can gain membership at [[The Forum]] by proving yourself at [[The Colosseum]].
* One day, you might:
	* Gain entry to [[The Forum]] and learn about [[Disciple Jaqub]]
	* Encounter [[Disciple Jaqub]] while adventuring
	* Learn about [[Disciple Jaqub]] after joining The Forum
* [[Disciple Jaqub]] will inform you about his role in the [[Awakened]] movement and his teacher, [[The Blasphemer]].
* You can talk to [[Hannibal Scipio]] and ask him to take on a bounty on [[The Blasphemer]].
* From this point, you can choose 2 options:
	* Become a follower of [[The Blasphemer]] as one of the messenger for his teachings. Starting [[Chapter 1 - The Judgment]]
	* Become a bounty hunter tasked to track down [[The Blasphemer]] and bring him to justice, starting [[Chapter 1 - The Bounty]]
	* Choosing one locks you to that questline for this playthrough.

You can become a messenger at any time
