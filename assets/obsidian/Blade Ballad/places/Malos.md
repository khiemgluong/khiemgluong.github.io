The world of Blade Ballad.

A supercontinent which is shaped like a sickle.
A reverse of the Hebrew definition for "עולם" (olam), prepending "s" to end.
**Malus** is Latin for "bad". Thus, Malos implies a cursed or evil world.

# Design Principle
Malos is designed to encompass many diverse regions with unique backgrounds. There is no central design "theme" in this world, but rather each region has its own theme. Like provinces of Tamriel, Cyrodiil has its own distinct style, weather, people and culture than that of Skyrim or Morrowind.
But the size of the world alone is not enough to bring depth, immersion and realism, and in fact, as I've come to observe, games with a massive worlds but no depth, story, engaging NPCs or dynamic world states, feels like they are "a mile wide but an inch deep," lacking substantive engagement.
## Buildings
One thing that has irked me in many games is the overabundance of buildings, homes, and manmade structures but no way to get inside any of them, which detracts from the realism and immersion of the game. For instance, in games like GTA or Cyberpunk, you might find a sprawling cityscape filled with thousands of buildings and towering skyscrapers, yet only a select few are accessible, and some of these interiors serve only as isolated backdrops for specific plot points.
I believe in enhancing immersion by scaling down the overall size of the game world but increasing accessibility. In Malos, every building will be enter-able, with fully designed interiors for each, which creates a world that feels more realistic and interactive. This is a design philosophy inspired by the more engaging, albeit smaller, worlds found in games like Fallout and Skyrim.
